That may well be the situation if the assistance or encouragement is rendered some time before the crime is committed and at a time when it is not clear what D1 may or may not decide to do. Another example might be where D2 supplies a weapon to D1, who has no lawful purpose in having it, intending to help D1 by giving him the means to commit a crime (or one of a range of crimes), but having no further interest in what he does, or indeed whether he uses it at all.' (Lord Hughes and Toulson, para. 90)<br>• 'In cases of secondary liability arising out of a prior joint criminal venture, it will also often be necessary to draw the jury’s attention to the fact that the intention to assist, and indeed the intention that the crime should be committed, may be conditional. The bank robbers who attack the bank when one or more of them is armed no doubt hope that it will not be necessary to use the guns, but it may be a perfectly proper inference that all were intending that if they met resistance the weapons should be used with the intent to do grievous bodily harm at least.'

(Lord Goff)<br>• 'The parellelism between the contractual and the tortious duty will in many cases make it unnecessary to plead both claims, but the coexistence of the claims leaves the plaintiff free to select so much of the course that offers the best advantage.'

Act 1919 (HTPCA 1919).<br>• However, HA 1925 contained no provision repealing HTPCA 1919.<br>• The appellant argued that it was exempted from compulsory acquisition due to HA 1925 and sought a declaration regarding the minister's power to purchase the land compulsorily.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The main issue at trial was whether the powers of compulsory acquisition under the HTPCA 1919 were impliedly repealed by the provisions of the HA 1925.<br>• The appellant argued that HA 1925 repealed the HTPCA 1919 by implication (since there were no express repeal provisions) due to the later statute's detailed and comprehensive regulations.<br>• The respondent (Minister of Health) argued that HA 1925 did not repeal HTPCA 1919, and therefore the minister still had the power to purchase the land compulsorily.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Court of Appeal held that the provisions of the HTPCA 1919 were not impliedly repealed by the HA 1925, and the minister retained the power to purchase the land compulsorily.<br>• The court reasoned that implied repeal requires a clear inconsistency between the two statutes, which was not present in this case. The court also suggested that the principle of implied repeal should only be applied as a last resort when no other interpretation is possible.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'The repeal of an earlier statute by implication by a later statute is a question of construction of the later, and depends upon there being in it such provisions as will demonstrate a legislative intention to make the earlier cease to have any operation.'

 "summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• In R v Lawrance [2020] EWCA Crim 971, the defendant, Jason Lawrance, had sexual intercourse with the complainant, known as 'C', on two occasions. <br>• On the first occasion, Lawrance explicitly agreed to withdraw (ejaculate) before climax. <br>• However, he did not withdraw on the second occasion. <br>• C, at the time, could conceivably become pregnant. <br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The central question in this case concerned whether Lawrance's deception about withdrawing before climax could vitiate C's consent to having sexual intercourse, and hence constitute rape. <br>• The Prosecution argued that this deception was similar to cases where individuals lie about their fertility or use of contraception, which might vitiate consent. <br>• The Defence argued that this deception did not operate at the point where consent was obtained but related to circumstances after obtaining consent. <br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Court of Appeal quashed Lawrance's conviction, concluding that his deception did not vitiate C's consent to the sexual act in question. <br>• In reaching this conclusion, the Court drew a distinction between deceptions that vitiate consent and those that do not, as laid down in R v Assange [2011] EWHC 2790 (Admin). <br>• The Court held that in this case, the deception by Lawrance did not operate at the point of obtaining consent, but rather after consent was given. <br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• '[We] are concerned with the commission of a criminal offence, and it is not appropriate to attach criminality to every breach of a highly nuanced and fact-specific agreement made by two consenting parties... The appellant's behaviour is morally and socially unacceptable behaviour, but we do not consider that the appellant's failure to withdraw amounted to a deception that vitiated the complainant's consent to sexual intercourse' (Lord Burnett CJ)."

 "summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• In the case of Spartan Steel & Alloys Ltd v Martin [1973] 1 QB 27, the defendants negligently caused a power outage. <br>• This power outage prevented the claimant, a third-party metal processing company, from collecting and transferring molten metal from the furnace to the casting machine, causing loss of property. <br>• Additionally, the claimant claimed damages for the lost profit on the destroyed metal and the lost profit on the metal that could not be produced during the power outage. <br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The main issue was whether the claimant could recover damages for the purely economic losses resulting from the defendant's negligence. <br>• The claimant argued they should be entitled to claim for both the lost profits and property damage. <br>• The defendant countered that the claimant should only be able to claim for the damaged property, not the economic loss. <br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The court held that the claimant could only recover damages for the property damage, not the lost profit. <br>• The rationale for this decision was to limit potential economic consequences stemming from a single negligent act, as too wide a scope would place an unfair burden on the defendant. <br>• This established the principle that pure economic loss is not recoverable in a claim for negligence. <br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• '…if the law does go so far, it might have disastrous effects on those who carry on a public service.

The vessel's proprietor sought an assessment of the damage by the classification society responsible for the vessel.<br>• At first, the classification society's representative suggested the vessel be placed in dry dock for repair. However, due to the owner's objections regarding the expenses, the recommendation was revised, and provisional repairs were executed instead.<br>• Following this, the vessel sank, causing the claimant to lose cargo valued at USD 17.6 million. The claimant obtained USD 17.5 million from the vessel's proprietor, corresponding to the total liability based on the vessel's size.<br>• The claimant then pursued the remaining sum from the classification society. Though initially successful, the claim was eventually overturned upon appeal. The claimant consequently appealed to the House of Lords.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The central issue was determining whether the required factors for assigning a duty of care to the classification society were established based on the facts presented.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The House of Lords ultimately ruled that the classification society did not owe a duty of care to the claimant in this case.<br>• The court restated the three criteria necessary for assigning a duty of care as set forth in Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605: proximity of relationship, foreseeability of damage, and whether the imposition of the duty would be equitable, just, and reasonable.<br>• While the first two components of this test were satisfied in the case, it was decided that assigning a duty of care to the classification society against the vessel's proprietor would be inequitable, unjust, and unreasonable. This decision was grounded in the fact that the vessel's proprietor should be the primary party responsible for recovery in such circumstances, in line with the globally acknowledged contractual framework in this domain.<br>• In addition, it would be inequitable, unjust, and unreasonable to impose liability on the classification society concerning the cargo owner, considering that classification societies operate for collective benefit and are not subject to any limitation provisions."

However, the four police officers brought a claim in tort against the Commissioner, arguing that he did not defend their innocence and seeking indemnification<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The question before the UK Supreme Court was whether the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis owed a duty of care to its police officers in a potentially tortious act and whether he was obliged to indemnify them.<br>• The police officers argued that the Commissioner owed them a duty of care and should protect them from having to meet a third-party claim.<br>• On the other hand, the Commissioner contended that he did not and that such an obligation fell outside of the scope of an employer-employee relationship<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Court held unanimously that the Commissioner did not owe a duty of care or indemnification to the four police officers against potential third-party claims.<br>• The Court noted that 'such a duty had not previously been identified and acknowledging it would raise significant public policy challenges.'<br>• The Court also cited the previous case of Friar v Newham London Borough Council [2011] EWCA Civ 281, where a duty of care to protect from pure economic loss was also rejected<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'There is simply no basis for concluding that the Commissioner owed a duty to the officers not to cause, or to protect them from, pure economic loss caused by the wrongdoing of others.'

 "summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• In GN v Poole Borough Council [2019] UKSC 25, the claimants (GN and CN) alleged that the defendant local authority (Poole Borough Council) failed in its duty to protect them from harassment and abuse by a neighboring family, resulting in physical harm and psychological trauma.<br>• GN and CN were young children and their family were receiving social services assistance from the local authority at the time. The claimants' family requested a transfer to a different housing location but were denied.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The key issue was whether the local authority owed a duty of care to the claimants under the principles of tort and negligence.<br>• The claimants argued that the local authority's failure to protect them or relocate their family demonstrated negligence in their duty of care.<br>• The local authority argued that, as a public body exercising statutory discretion, it did not owe the claimants a duty of care.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court dismissed the claimants' appeal, agreeing with the local authority that it did not owe the claimants a duty of care.<br>• The Court reasoned that imposing a duty of care on local authorities in such cases would lead to a risk of defensive practices and diversion of resources from their statutory functions.<br>• The Court relied on previous cases such as Mitchell v Glasgow City Council [2009] UKHL 11 and Michael v Chief Constable of South Wales [2015] UKSC 2 to reinforce that public authorities do not owe a general duty of care to protect individuals from harm caused by third parties."

Bush [1989] 3 WLR 790, the defendants were surveyors instructed by the plaintiffs' mortgage lender to value the plaintiffs' house.<br>• The plaintiffs purchased the house for £35,000 based on the defendants' valuation.<br>• It was later discovered that the house suffered from structural defects requiring extensive repair work, causing the property value to be worth much less.<br>• The plaintiffs sued the defendants for negligent misstatement, claiming that they breached their duty of care by providing a valuation that significantly overestimated the house's actual worth.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The primary issue was whether the defendants owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs, resulting in liability for negligent misstatement.<br>• The defendants argued that no duty of care was owed because they were chosen by and acted solely for the mortgage lender, with no direct relationship with the plaintiffs.<br>• The plaintiffs argued that such a duty existed, as they relied on the valuation provided by the defendants when deciding to purchase the house.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The court held in favour of the plaintiffs, finding that the defendants owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs.<br>• The court noted that surveyors providing valuations owe a duty of care to house buyers who reasonably rely on their advice. This was based on the test established in Hedley Byrne v Heller & Partners Ltd [1964] AC 465, that a duty of care arises when there is reliance on advice given in a situation where the adviser knows, or ought reasonably to know, that the recipient relies and intends to act on that advice.<br>• In this case, the defendants knew or ought to have known that their valuation would be relied upon by the plaintiffs in deciding whether to purchase.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'The lender may reasonably foresee that, if the [valuation] is prepared negligently, a borrower who relies upon it in entering into the transaction may suffer loss.

Is there a relationship between the defendant (Ministry of Justice) and the tortfeasor (prisoner) that is capable of giving rise to vicarious liability? <br>  2. Is there a sufficiently 'close connection' between the relationship and the tortious act?<br>• The court concluded that both elements were satisfied and therefore, the Ministry of Justice was vicariously liable. <br><br><strong>Key passage</strong><br>• 'Although the relationship between the Ministry of Justice and the prisoner who injured Mrs Cox was not one of employment in the ordinary sense, it was still a relationship that was sufficiently akin to that of employer and employee for the principle of vicarious liability to apply.'
