    "summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• Shamima Begum was a British citizen who left the UK to join ISIS in Syria.<br>• In 2019, the Home Secretary revoked her citizenship on the basis that she was a security threat to the UK.<br>• Begum challenged this decision in court, arguing that it made her stateless and that she could not effectively challenge it from Syria.<br>• The Court of Appeal found that the decision was unlawful because it rendered Begum stateless and because she would not be able to have a fair and effective appeal against it.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The main issues in the case were whether the Home Secretary's decision to revoke Begum's citizenship was lawful, and whether it breached her right to a fair and effective appeal.<br>• The Home Secretary argued that the decision was taken in the interests of national security, and that Begum was not rendered stateless because she was entitled to Bangladeshi citizenship through her parents.<br>• Begum argued that she was effectively stateless because she had never been to Bangladesh and did not have any connection to the country.<br>• She also argued that she could not effectively challenge the decision from Syria, where she was living in a refugee camp without access to legal representation or evidence.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously allowed the Home Secretary's appeal against the Court of Appeal's decision.<br>• The Court found that the decision to revoke Begum's citizenship did not breach her right to a fair and effective appeal because she could pursue her case from Syria with the assistance of lawyers and that the decision did not render her stateless as she could claim Bangladeshi citizenship.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'the right to a fair hearing does not trump all other considerations, such as the safety of the public. If a vital public interest makes it impossible for a case to be fairly heard then the courts cannot ordinarily hear it. The appropriate response to the problem in the present case is for the deprivation appeal to be stayed until Ms Begum is in a position to play an effective part in it without the safety of the public being compromised.'

      "summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• Following the referendum vote to leave the European Union (EU) in 2016, the UK government triggered Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, beginning the process of leaving the EU.<br>• The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, advised the Queen to prorogue (suspend) Parliament for five weeks, claiming it was necessary to prepare a new legislative agenda.<br>• However, the suspension was challenged by Gina Miller, who argued that it was an unlawful abuse of power by the Prime Minister to prevent parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The central issue in this case was whether the advice given by the Prime Minister to the Queen to prorogue Parliament was justiciable (capable of being reviewed by the courts) and, if so, whether it was lawful.<br>• Miller argued that the Prime Minister's advice was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the constitutional role of Parliament in holding the government to account.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously held that the Prime Minister's advice to prorogue Parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the constitutional role of Parliament without reasonable justification.<br>• The prorogation was therefore void and of no effect.<br>• The Court also held that the advice was justiciable, meaning that the courts have the power to review it.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'The Prime Minister's advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the Order in Council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed.

Parliament has not been prorogued' (Lady Hale).<br>• 'The longer that Parliament stands prorogued, the greater the risk that responsible government may be replaced by unaccountable government: the antithesis of the democratic model' (Lady Hale)."

The importance of the rule of law is not always understood. Indications of a lack of understanding include the assumption that the administration of justice is merely a public service like any other, that courts and tribunals are providers of services to the “users” who appear before them, and that the provision of those services is of value only to the users themselves and to those who are remunerated for their participation in the proceedings. The extent to which that viewpoint has gained currency in recent times is apparent from the consultation papers and reports discussed earlier. It sometimes seems as though Lord Woolf’s reforms, which were designed to enable the courts to serve the people better, have turned into a mechanism for the management of the justice system in the interests of the efficiency of the courts rather than in the interests of the people for whose benefit the courts exist.'

This condition is more likely to occur in women with diabetes.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The key issue was whether the doctors had a duty to disclose the risk of shoulder dystocia to Montgomery.<br>• The doctors argued that they had acted in accordance with their usual practice, which did not include informing patients of the risk of shoulder dystocia.<br>• They also argued that a warning would have led to Montgomery requesting a caesarean section, which would have been riskier for her and her baby.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court held that the doctors had a duty to disclose the risk of shoulder dystocia to Montgomery.<br>• The court stated that doctors have a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that patients are aware of any material risks involved in any recommended treatment, and of any reasonable alternative or variant treatments.<br>• The court also held that the doctor's usual practice was not enough to discharge their duty to provide Montgomery with the information she needed to make an informed decision about her treatment.<br>• The court found that Montgomery would have chosen to have a caesarean section if she had been informed of the risks.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'An adult person of sound mind is entitled to decide which, if any, of the available forms of treatment to undergo, and her consent must be obtained before treatment interfering with her bodily integrity is undertaken.

The assessment of what risks and benefits would be reasonable to disclose, and how they should be presented and assessed, in any given case is a matter for expert judgment.

Although the Health Board had breached their duty of care, they were not liable to pay the expenses associated with raising the child, as the birth of a healthy child is not a loss capable of being remedied.<br>• They considered the case of Doyle v Olby Ironmongers Ltd [1969] 2 QB 158 and held that it was distinguishable from the present case, as it allowed for compensation for the loss of capacity to have children rather than for the birth of a child.<br>• Furthermore, awarding damages for raising a child would be against the public interest as it could potentially deter life-enhancing health care treatment.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s):</strong><br>• Lord Steyn: 'The general answer to the question whether a person may sue for damages for the costs of bringing up a child is that the law regards the birth of a normal, healthy child as a blessing and not as constituting a recognizable source of loss.'"

(Lord Reid)<br>• 'In cases where the damage is brought about by the deliberate act of a third party, it is relevant in determining whether a duty of care existed to consider the likelihood of such an intervening act: if the whole course of events is likely, the existence of a duty of care may be established but not otherwise.' (Lord Morris)<br>• 'Once it is established that the man who creates a source of danger is potentially liable to anyone, whether he be an adult or a child or a madman or a criminal, - who can reasonably be anticipated to be exposed to that risk, it might logically be thought that the creator of the danger should also be liable to anyone who acts just as foreseeably in response to the temptation which the danger presents.'
