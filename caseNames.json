That may well be the situation if the assistance or encouragement is rendered some time before the crime is committed and at a time when it is not clear what D1 may or may not decide to do. Another example might be where D2 supplies a weapon to D1, who has no lawful purpose in having it, intending to help D1 by giving him the means to commit a crime (or one of a range of crimes), but having no further interest in what he does, or indeed whether he uses it at all.' (Lord Hughes and Toulson, para. 90)<br>• 'In cases of secondary liability arising out of a prior joint criminal venture, it will also often be necessary to draw the jury’s attention to the fact that the intention to assist, and indeed the intention that the crime should be committed, may be conditional. The bank robbers who attack the bank when one or more of them is armed no doubt hope that it will not be necessary to use the guns, but it may be a perfectly proper inference that all were intending that if they met resistance the weapons should be used with the intent to do grievous bodily harm at least.'

By what measure is the comparative value of lives to be measured? Is it to be strength, or intellect or what? It is plain that the principle leaves to him who is to profit by it to determine the necessity which will justify him in deliberately taking another's life to save his own. In this case the weakest, the youngest, the most unresisting, was chosen. Was it more necessary to kill him than one of the grown men? The answer must be 'No'. (Lord Coleridge CJ)"

These cases emphasized that in order for an equity to recognize a completed gift, the donor must have done all in his power to transfer the property.<br>• The court further held that Mr. Rose's actions to transfer the shares had removed them from his estate, therefore reducing the Estate Duty payable."

      "summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• The appellant, Mr. Rosset, purchased a house in joint names with his wife using funds borrowed from the respondent, Lloyds Bank.<br>• Mrs. Rosset spent considerable time and money renovating the property, believing that this would give her a beneficial interest in the property.<br>• When Mr. Rosset defaulted on the loan, Lloyds Bank sought to repossess the property, claiming that Mrs. Rosset had no beneficial interest in it.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• Lloyds Bank argued that Mrs. Rosset did not have a beneficial interest in the property because there was no express agreement between the parties, and her contributions did not amount to a constructive trust.<br>• Mrs. Rosset contended that she had a beneficial interest in the property under a constructive trust due to her direct financial and labor contributions.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The House of Lords held that Mrs. Rosset did not have a beneficial interest in the property.<br>• There was no evidence of an express agreement between the parties, and her contributions did not amount to a constructive trust as they were not directly related to the initial acquisition of the property.<br>• Consequently, Lloyds Bank was entitled to repossess the property.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'The first and fundamental question which must always be resolved is whether, independently of any inference to be drawn from the conduct of the parties in the course of sharing the house as their home and managing their joint affairs, there has at any time prior to acquisition, or exceptionally at some later date, been any agreement, arrangement or understanding reached between them that the property is to be shared beneficially. The finding of an agreement or arrangement to share in this sense can only, I think, be based on evidence of express discussions between the partners, however imperfectly remembered and however imprecise their terms may have been. Once a finding to this effect is made it will only be necessary for the partner asserting a claim to a beneficial interest against the partner entitled to the legal estate to show that he or she has acted to his or her detriment or significantly altered his or her position in reliance on the agreement in order to give rise to a constructive trust or a proprietary estoppel.': Lord Bridge<br>• 'It was common ground that Mrs. Rosset was extremely anxious that the new matrimonial home should be ready for occupation before Christmas if possible. In these circumstances it would seem the most natural thing in the world for any wife, in the absence of her husband abroad, to spend all the time she could spare and to employ any skills she might have, such as the ability to decorate a room, in doing all she could to accelerate progress of the work quite irrespective of any expectation she might have of enjoying a beneficial interest in the property.': Lord Bridge"

 "summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• In the case of Spartan Steel & Alloys Ltd v Martin [1973] 1 QB 27, the defendants negligently caused a power outage. <br>• This power outage prevented the claimant, a third-party metal processing company, from collecting and transferring molten metal from the furnace to the casting machine, causing loss of property. <br>• Additionally, the claimant claimed damages for the lost profit on the destroyed metal and the lost profit on the metal that could not be produced during the power outage. <br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The main issue was whether the claimant could recover damages for the purely economic losses resulting from the defendant's negligence. <br>• The claimant argued they should be entitled to claim for both the lost profits and property damage. <br>• The defendant countered that the claimant should only be able to claim for the damaged property, not the economic loss. <br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The court held that the claimant could only recover damages for the property damage (and the lost profit on this damaged property), not the lost profit for the period for which the factory was not operational (which was pure economic loss). <br>• The rationale for this decision was to limit potential economic consequences stemming from a single negligent act, as too wide a scope would place an unfair burden on the defendant. <br>• This established the principle that pure economic loss is not recoverable in a claim for negligence."

  "keywords": ["tort", "survey", "cracks", "vessels", "maritime"],
 "summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• A vessel experienced a fracture in its hull during a trip. The vessel's proprietor sought an assessment of the damage by the classification society responsible for the vessel.<br>• At first, the classification society's representative suggested the vessel be placed in dry dock for repair. However, due to the owner's objections regarding the expenses, the recommendation was revised, and provisional repairs were executed instead.<br>• Following this, the vessel sank, causing the claimant to lose cargo valued at USD 17.6 million. The claimant obtained USD 17.5 million from the vessel's proprietor, corresponding to the total liability based on the vessel's size.<br>• The claimant then pursued the remaining sum from the classification society. Though initially successful, the claim was eventually overturned upon appeal. The claimant consequently appealed to the House of Lords.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The central issue was determining whether the required factors for assigning a duty of care to the classification society were established based on the facts presented.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The House of Lords ultimately ruled that the classification society did not owe a duty of care to the claimant in this case.<br>• The court restated the three criteria necessary for assigning a duty of care as set forth in Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605: proximity of relationship, foreseeability of damage, and whether the imposition of the duty would be equitable, just, and reasonable.<br>• While the first two components of this test were satisfied in the case, it was decided that assigning a duty of care to the classification society against the vessel's proprietor would be inequitable, unjust, and unreasonable. This decision was grounded in the fact that the vessel's proprietor should be the primary party responsible for recovery in such circumstances, in line with the globally acknowledged contractual framework in this domain.<br>• In addition, it would be inequitable, unjust, and unreasonable to impose liability on the classification society concerning the cargo owner, considering that classification societies operate for collective benefit and are not subject to any limitation provisions."

One is that a person should not be allowed to profit from his own wrongdoing.

It is integral to the claim. The crime of escape is a serious one; it is a common law offence for which the penalty is at large. It is almost invariably punished by a sentence of imprisonment, although the length of the sentence is usually measured in months rather than years. In my judgment it is plainly a sufficiently serious offence for the purpose of the application of [ex turpi causa].'"

When the will was being contested, Browne, the solicitor, who prepared the will, testified that Chalmers was of sound mind. The plaintiff's counsel disputed that Browne committed a fraud in preparing the will but did not cross-examine him on his credibility.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The main issue is whether it is mandatory to confront a witness with allegations of misconduct when attempting to impeach their credibility in cross-examination as part of the adversarial process in English law.<br>• The argument for Browne is that the court should require the opponents to cross-examine the witness on disputed issues of fact or credibility before impeaching the witness' credibility.<br>• The argument for Dunn is that the court should not require the opponents to cross-examine the witness on disputed issues of fact or credibility but can proceed to impeach the witness' credibility by introducing evidence that contradicts the witness.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Browne-Dunn rule was established: when a party seeks to impeach a witness' credibility based on conflicting evidence, proper notice of the issue must be given during cross-examination. If the adverse party seeks to present evidence contradicting a witness, they must give the witness the opportunity to address the issue during cross-examination.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• '...it seems to me to be absolutely essential to the proper conduct of a case, where it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on a particular point, to direct his attention to the fact by some questions put in cross-examination showing that that imputation is intended to be made...'

When the company failed, he sought to rescind the contract and recover his money on the grounds of fraudulent misrepresentation.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The issue in this case was whether the defendant's false statement of their present intention, i.e., how the funds would be used, amounted to an actionable misrepresentation.<br>• The claimant argued that the prospectus contained false statements which induced him to invest in the company.<br>• The defendants contended that their statements were not actionable misrepresentations as they were merely statements of intention, and that the misrepresentations were not the sole reason for the plaintiff's investment.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The court held that the defendant's statement of present intention was an actionable misrepresentation, as it directly affected Mr. Edgington's decision to invest in the company.

Is there a relationship between the defendant (Ministry of Justice) and the tortfeasor (prisoner) that is capable of giving rise to vicarious liability? <br>  2.

The prison service carries on activities in furtherance of its aims. … Prisoners working in the prison kitchens, such as Mr Inder, are integrated into the operation of the prison, so that the activities assigned to them by the prison service form an integral part of the activities which it carries on in the furtherance of its aims: in particular, the activity of providing meals for prisoners. They are placed by the prison service in a position where there is a risk that they may commit a variety of negligent acts within the field of activities assigned to them. That is recognised by the health and safety training which they receive. Furthermore, they work under the direction of prison staff. Mrs Cox was injured as a result of negligence by Mr Inder in carrying on the activities assigned to him. The prison service is therefore vicariously liable to her.' (Lord Reed at para. 32)"

"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• Mr Carré was exposed to asbestos dust by his employer, 'GGLCL', for 27 years and later contracted mesothelioma.<br>• Carré sued the Respondent ('IEG'), as the successor in title of GGLCL, and recovered £250,000 damages and £15,300 in costs.<br>• IEG also incurred defence costs of £13,151.60.<br>• GGLCL had two insurance policies, one for 2 years and the other, 'Zurich', for 6 years.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The Supreme Court had to decide whether the reasoning in Barker still applies in Guernsey, and if their decision would mean that an employer’s liability insurer covering an employer for only part of the period during which the employer exposed a victim is liable for only a pro rata part of the employer’s liability to the victim.<br>• If Barker does not apply, the Supreme Court had to determine whether such an insurer is liable in the first instance for the whole of the employer’s liability to the victim and if so, the Supreme Court needed to decide whether the insurer has pro rata rights to contribution from any other insurer of that employer and/or from the employer in respect of any periods not covered by the insurer.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously held that the common law rule of proportionate recovery established in Barker continues to apply in Guernsey.<br>• Zurich’s appeal in respect of compensation was allowed but dismissed in relation to defence costs.<br>• The majority of the Court concluded that Zurich would have been liable in the first instance to meet IEG’s claim in respect of their compensation but would have been entitled to pro rata contribution from Excess and IEG."

The Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland (Respondent) was one of them. The Deed was executed in 1986, amended in 1993, and replaced in 1997. <br>• Pre-Tax Profits were defined as the 'group profit before taxation' or 'group loss before taxation' shown in the Audited Accounts. The Deed was to be understood in the original legal and accounting context, where realized profits were included in the profit and loss account.<br>• Following the acquisition of HBOS in 2009, the Appellant's Audited Accounts included a 'gain on acquisition' of over £11 billion. The Respondent claimed this constituted the group profit, entitling them to a payment of £3,543,333, while the Appellant argued that 'gain on acquisition' should be disregarded, entitling the Respondent to only £38,920.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The key issue was whether the 'gain on acquisition' should be included in the pre-tax profits when calculating the payments due to the Respondent under the Deed. The Appellant contended that it should be excluded as it was unthinkable at the time the Deed was made, while the Respondent argued the opposite.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court unanimously allowed the appeal and restored the Lord Ordinary’s decree of absolvitor, dismissing the claim. <br>• They reasoned that the Deed should be understood in the original legal and accounting context when realized profits were included in the profit and loss account. The Respondent should not derive any benefit from an unrealized gain that it could not derive from a realized profit. <br>• The Court did not equitably adjust the contract as while the performance was no longer as originally contemplated, it was not impossible or destroyed."

Court of Appeal decision affirmed, appeal dismissed.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'It is not enough that the fault should be the fault of a servant in order to exonerate the owner, the fault must also be one which is not the fault of the owner, or a fault to which the owner is privy; and I take the view that when anybody sets up that section to excuse himself from the normal consequences of the maxim respondeat superior the burden lies upon him to do so.' (Viscount Haldane L.C.).<br>• 'I think they have not discharged the onus which was upon them, and that it must be taken that the unseaworthiness, which I hold to have been established as existing at the commencement of the voyage from Novorossisk, was an unseaworthiness which did not exist without the actual fault or privity of the owning company.'

Lord Hoffmann held that the actual decision in Cocks v. Thanet District Council [1983] 2 AC 286 showed no private law action could be pursued in these circumstances. <br>• Furthermore, Lord Hoffmann found it implausible that Parliament intended to embed one temporary duty enforceable by a private action in tort within an Act imposing various other important duties that were only enforceable in public law.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• Lord Hoffmann: 'In principle and on the authority of the actual decision of this House in Cocks v.

The court held that proof of suspicion was not sufficient for a count of attempted money laundering.<br>• The mental element required for attempt was the same as that for the substantive offence, meaning an intent to convert criminal property. <br><br><strong>Key passage(s):</strong><br>• 'A constituent element of the offence of converting criminal property is, as we have said, that the property in question is criminal property.

Where in a given case both defences are potentially available, on the facts, then a judge should seek to adopt one to the exclusion of the other. In the present case, the more apposite defence, on the facts, on count 3 (and especially given the presence on the indictment of the count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm) was self-defence.'<br>• Lord Justice Davis: 'Thus our overall conclusion on the main question raised by this case is that, while it is likely to be a rare case on the facts where self-defence is even capable of arising with regard to a count of dangerous (or careless) driving, such defence is in principle capable as a matter of law of being available on such a count.

There is, of course, nothing in that phrase to suggest that the notification to the defendant could not be made by post. But the requirement of 'notice ... to', in my judgment, is language which should be taken expressly to assert the ordinary situation in law that acceptance requires to be communicated or notified to the offeror, and is inconsistent with the theory that acceptance can be constituted by the act of posting, referred to by Anson as 'acceptance without notification'.'<br>• LORD JUSTICE LAWTON: 'Now in this case, the 'notice in writing' was to be one 'to the Intending Vendor'. It was to be an intimation to him that the grantee had exercised the option: he was the one who was to be fixed with the information contained in the writing. He never was, because the letter carrying the information went astray. The plaintiffs were unable to do what the agreement said they were to do, namely, fix the defendant with knowledge that they had decided to buy his property. If this construction of the option clause is correct, there is no room for the application of any rule of law relating to the acceptance of offers by posting letters since the option agreement stipulated what had to be done to exercise the option.

The respondent's condition continued to deteriorate, and she eventually needed urgent surgery to drain seven litres of bile from her abdomen.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong>:<br>• The respondent alleged that the appellant was negligent as an injury to the common bile duct had occurred during the respondent's operation and the appellant had failed to require fluid balance and renal monitoring of her condition.<br>• The appellant contended that the judge had erred in finding that the mere fact of postoperative injury to the common bile duct (a recognised possible complication of the procedure) was evidence of a negligent act.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong>:<br>• The court dismissed the appeal, upholding the judge’s conclusion of negligence. The court found that once it was established that the injury was not in the area of the operation, the defendant's inability to explain what had occurred was 'compelling evidence' in support of the negligence claim.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong>:<br>• 'Mr McDonald, it will be recalled, had proceeded in his evidence on the basis that the cystic duct on which the operation took place joined the common bile duct i.e. that there was no variation in this case.

The present relevance of Mr McDonald's evidence on that point is that in the course of his evidence it became clear that one reason he was proceeding on that basis was that otherwise he could not explain how an injury had occurred to the common bile duct.' - Lord Justice Lloyd Jones <br>• 'Once it was established that injury was not in the area of the operation, Mr McDonald could not offer any explanation for the injury... The inability of Mr McDonald to account for how the injury occurred was therefore a powerful pointer to the negligence of the appellant during the surgery.' - Lord Justice Lloyd Jones"

The judge had two reasons for so deciding, only one of which is endorsed by two members of this Court.

If the law required training or supervision in this case, it would equally be required for a multitude of other commonplace leisure activities which nevertheless carry with them a degree of obvious inherent risk...

Hoenig completed the work but Isaacs complained of deficiencies in some items. Isaacs paid £400 but refused to pay the remaining £350.<br>• Hoenig sued for the outstanding £350. Isaacs argued that Hoenig had breached the contract by failing to provide items as specified and therefore the remaining sum was not payable.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• Hoenig argued that the contract was substantially completed and therefore the remaining balance was payable. He disputed the assertion that the contract was an 'entire' contract whereby full performance was a condition precedent to payment.<br>• Isaacs argued that the contract was an 'entire' contract, and since Hoenig did not fully perform his obligations, the balance was not payable.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Court found in favour of Hoenig. It held that Hoenig had substantially performed the contract and was consequently entitled to the £350.<br>• The court found 'entire performance' was not a condition precedent to payment and thus a failure to fully perform did not absolve Isaacs from his obligation to pay the remaining balance.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'When a contract provides for a specific sum to be paid on completion of specified work, the Courts lean against a construction of the contract which would deprive the contractor of any payment at all simply because there are some defects or omissions. The promise to complete the work is therefore construed as a term of the contract, but not as a condition.' (Lord Justice Denning)"

"name": "Holwell Securities v Hughes [1973] EWCA Civ 5",
"keywords": ["Contract law", "Acceptance", "Notice", "Communication", "Postal rule"],
"summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• Holwell Securities (the plaintiff) had an option to purchase a property from Hughes (the defendant), which required notice of exercise in writing to Hughes.<br>• The option was stipulated to be exercisable by notice in writing to Hughes.<br>• Holwell Securities posted the written notice exercising the option to Hughes, but it was never received by Hughes.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• Plaintiff contended the option was validly exercised by postal dispatch, even if the letter did not reach Hughes. They argued that the 'postal rule' (communication of acceptance is complete as soon as it is posted) applied.<br>• Hughes disputed this, insisting the option wasn't effectively exercised due to not receiving any written notice.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Court held that the plaintiff's attempted exercise of the option by posting the letter was not effective because Hughes did not receive the letter. It was determined that the 'postal rule' did not apply in this case due to the stipulation of notice in writing to Hughes.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'It is the law in the first place that prima facie acceptance of an offer must be communicated to the offeror...In any case, before one can find that the basic principle of the need for communication of acceptance to the offeror is displaced by this artificial concept of communication by the act of posting, it is necessary that the offer is in its terms consistent with such displacement' - Lord Justice Russell.<br>• 'It is a truism of the law relating to options that the grantee must comply strictly with the conditions stipulated for exercise: see Hare v. Nicholl, 1966 2 Queen's Bench, 130...On this ground alone I would dismiss the appeal'- Lord Justice Lawton."
