If a vital public interest makes it impossible for a case to be fairly heard then the courts cannot ordinarily hear it.

The importance of the rule of law is not always understood. Indications of a lack of understanding include the assumption that the administration of justice is merely a public service like any other, that courts and tribunals are providers of services to the “users” who appear before them, and that the provision of those services is of value only to the users themselves and to those who are remunerated for their participation in the proceedings. The extent to which that viewpoint has gained currency in recent times is apparent from the consultation papers and reports discussed earlier. It sometimes seems as though Lord Woolf’s reforms, which were designed to enable the courts to serve the people better, have turned into a mechanism for the management of the justice system in the interests of the efficiency of the courts rather than in the interests of the people for whose benefit the courts exist.'

This condition is more likely to occur in women with diabetes.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The key issue was whether the doctors had a duty to disclose the risk of shoulder dystocia to Montgomery.<br>• The doctors argued that they had acted in accordance with their usual practice, which did not include informing patients of the risk of shoulder dystocia.<br>• They also argued that a warning would have led to Montgomery requesting a caesarean section, which would have been riskier for her and her baby.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The Supreme Court held that the doctors had a duty to disclose the risk of shoulder dystocia to Montgomery.<br>• The court stated that doctors have a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that patients are aware of any material risks involved in any recommended treatment, and of any reasonable alternative or variant treatments.<br>• The court also held that the doctor's usual practice was not enough to discharge their duty to provide Montgomery with the information she needed to make an informed decision about her treatment.<br>• The court found that Montgomery would have chosen to have a caesarean section if she had been informed of the risks.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'An adult person of sound mind is entitled to decide which, if any, of the available forms of treatment to undergo, and her consent must be obtained before treatment interfering with her bodily integrity is undertaken.

(Lord Kerr)<br>• 'Neither the doctor nor the patient is the arbiter of objective reasonableness. The assessment of what risks and benefits would be reasonable to disclose, and how they should be presented and assessed, in any given case is a matter for expert judgment. In making that assessment, the doctor must take into account the characteristics of the patient, including her age, her sex, her state of health, and all other relevant aspects of her medical condition.

These cases emphasized that in order for an equity to recognize a completed gift, the donor must have done all in his power to transfer the property.<br>• The court further held that Mr. Rose's actions to transfer the shares had removed them from his estate, therefore reducing the Estate Duty payable.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'If the donor has done all that is necessary to be done by him to effect a change of legal title and has put it in the power of his transferee to effect such change of title, then it is a question of intent whether the gift is complete.'

  "summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• In Re G (Children) (Residence: Same-sex Partner) [2005] UKHL 43, the appellant and respondent were a lesbian couple who had entered into a same-sex relationship.<br>• The appellant was the biological mother of two children, conceived through donor insemination.<br>• The couple's relationship ended and the appellant formed a new relationship with a man and subsequently moved with the children to Cornwall.<br>• The respondent sought a shared residence order, which was initially granted by the family court.<br>• The Court of Appeal subsequently set aside the shared residence order, granting a limited contact order in favor of the respondent.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The House of Lords had to determine the appropriate standard of appellate review in cases involving disputes between a biological parent and a non-biological parent.<br>• The appellant argued that the Court of Appeal had erred in overturning the shared residence order, and that the best interests of the children were served by granting her sole residence.<br>• The respondent argued that the shared residence order should be reinstated, as she had played a significant role in the children's lives.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The House of Lord reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal, reinstating the shared residence order.<br>• It held that the Court of Appeal had erred in its approach to appellate review, as it was not entitled to interfere with the exercise of discretion by the family court unless the appellate court could establish that the judge's decision was plainly wrong or resulted from an error of law.<br>• In the present case, it was determined that there was no error of law or plainly wrong result in the judge's decision to grant the shared residence order.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'In my view it is clear that the judge's decision can only be overturned if it is shown either that he made errors of law, or that no reasonable judge applying the right law could have arrived at his conclusion, or that his decision was wrong so as to be unjust.': (Baroness Hale)<br>• 'I agree that the same-sex aspect of this case does not have a bearing on the outcome, and should not have a bearing on the result of other cases which are now proceeding or which will come before the courts in the future.': (Lord Nicholls)<br>• 'The question for the appellate court is not whether they would have made the same order but whether the order which was made by the experienced specialist judge was within the ambit of proper judicial decision-making.': (Lord Walker)"

  "summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• Ready Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd (RMC) entered into a contract for the supply of labour to deliver goods to their customers.<br>• The contract required the workers to provide a lorry, fuel and a driver for the lorry.<br>• The contract also stated that the workers were self-employed, and not employees of RMC.<br>• The contract contained a clause that the parties did not intend it to create a legal relationship.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The issue before the court was whether the workers were employees or independent contractors.<br>• The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance argued that the workers were employees, as they were under RMC's control.<br>• RMC contended that the workers were independent contractors, as per their contract.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The court held that the workers were independent contractors, not employees of RMC.<br>• The court applied the 'control test' (from Yewens v Noakes [1880] 6 QBD 530) and found that RMC had inadequate control over the workers for them to be considered employees.<br>• The court also considered other factors relevant to the worker's relationship with RMC, including their right to substitute a driver and the fact that they provided their own equipment and resources.<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'A contract of service exists if these three conditions are fulfilled. (i) The servant agrees that, in consideration of a wage or other remuneration, he will provide his own work and skill in the performance of some service for his master. (ii) He agrees, expressly or impliedly, that in the performance of that service he will be subject to the other's control in a sufficient degree to make that other master. (iii) The other provisions of the contract are consistent with its being a contract of service.' (Diplock LJ)<br>• 'One of the considerations to which emphasis is often given in distinguishing between a contract of service and a contract for services is the degree of control which the hirer exercises.'

  "summary": "<strong>Facts</strong><br>• In Foss v Harbottle (1843) 67 ER 189, two minority shareholders (Foss and Turton) in a company called Victoria Park Company sought relief from the court for alleged mismanagement by the company's board of directors (Harbottle, White, Chapman, and Booth).<br>• They claimed that the defendants misappropriated the company's funds and caused the company to enter into illegal and unauthorized contracts.<br>• The claimants demanded that the company bring a lawsuit against the directors for the alleged breaches of their fiduciary duty.<br><br><strong>Issues</strong><br>• The claimants argued that the directors' actions constituted a breach of their fiduciary duty and that a derivative action (where shareholders bring an action on behalf of the company) should be allowed.<br>• The defendants argued that the alleged wrongs could be ratified by a simple majority of shareholders, and since the majority had approved the directors' actions, there was no legal basis for the derivative action.<br><br><strong>Decision</strong><br>• The court dismissed the claimants' case, holding that the wrongs alleged were capable of being ratified by a simple majority of shareholders, and as such, the court had no jurisdiction to intervene.<br>• The court established the Foss v Harbottle rule, which states that a claim by an individual shareholder on behalf of the company (derivative action) can only be pursued if the alleged wrong is incapable of being ratified by a simple majority of shareholders.<br>• This case laid the foundations for the separate legal personality of a company in English law, as well as the proper plaintiff principle (Rule in Foss v Harbottle).<br><br><strong>Key passage(s)</strong><br>• 'There must always be some differences in disputes between the management and the corporators; but courts of law were not instituted to determine such matters, provided the directors are acting within their authority; if there is an abuse of that authority, if the majority or the body act fraudulently or collusively, then, indeed, the jurisdiction of the court is properly appealed to,' (Wigram VC).<br>• 'The whole mischief complained of was, in truth, the misapplication of the funds of the company; now this being the case, although that misapplication might be a great practical grievance to those who are members of the company, yet the parties who suffered have the means, by means of their legal rights, of redressing the wrong.'
